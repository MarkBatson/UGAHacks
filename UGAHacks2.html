    <h3 class="what-is">What exactly is a hackathon?</h3>
    <p class="hack-description">Hackathons are all about groups of dedicated people coming together at a workspace to create something awesome. The 36 hour hackaton is free and open to anyone.</p>
    <hr class="grey-line" width="20%" color="#D3D3D3"/>
    <p class="hack-description-2">It includes mentors, free food, video game competitions, social mixers and more. There's even mixers at the event for anyone that still needs to find some teammates!</p>

    <h3 class="what-make">What do you make at a hackathon?</h3>
    <p class="make-1">Hackathon creations usually revolve around technology. Things like hardware, programs, games, and apps are great choices, but these are only a few examples.</p>
    <p class="make-2">At a hackathon, you can make anything you want. From prjectors created out of trash, to exciting new apps, to wacky inventions, the possibilities are endless.</p>
